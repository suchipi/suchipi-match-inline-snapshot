- [x] seems you have to run multiple times to update multiple snapshots.
  - [x] need to get all changes for that file in one place and flush them afterwards.
    - [x] default flush impl should use setTimeout 0, but there should be a way to disable that and manually flush (for test framework integration).
- [ ] make `matchInlineSnapshot.u` a way of updating a single snapshot quickly
- [x] add a way to hook into the common `expect(a).toMatchInlineSnapshot(b)` signature. maybe support both by default?
  - [ ] add a test for that case specifically
- [ ] indent snapshots
  - part of this is making snapshots with arbitrary indentation still match.
- [ ] run prettier after updating snapshots if they have prettier configured.
- [ ] runtime type validation of all the config stuff
