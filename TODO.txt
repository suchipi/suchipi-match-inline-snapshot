- [x] seems you have to run multiple times to update multiple snapshots.
  - [x] need to get all changes for that file in one place and flush them afterwards.
    - [x] default flush impl should use setTimeout 0, but there should be a way to disable that and manually flush (for test framework integration).
- [x] make `matchInlineSnapshot.u` a way of updating a single snapshot quickly
- [x] add a way to hook into the common `expect(a).toMatchInlineSnapshot(b)` signature. maybe support both by default?
  - [x] add a test for that case specifically
- [ ] indent snapshots
  - [x] part of this is making snapshots with arbitrary indentation still match.
- [ ] run prettier after updating snapshots if they have prettier configured.
  - [ ] might be nice for this to be wired using a generic "after update" api function hook thing
- [x] runtime type validation of all the config stuff
- [x] fix SourceMap type in error-utils to be compatible with the one from mozilla source-map library
- [x] make config validation failure error message better
- [x] make sure all the config stuff is in the readme
- [x] test if it works in bun and make it work there if it doesn't
- [x] make sure everything works with `\r\n` line endings
- [ ] add automated test for sourcemap stuff
