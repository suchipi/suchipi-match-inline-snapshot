- seems you have to run multiple times to update multiple snapshots.
  - need to get all changes for that file in one place and flush them afterwards.
    - default flush impl should use setTimeout 0, but there should be a way to disable that and manually flush (for test framework integration).
- make `matchInlineSnapshot.u` a way of updating a single snapshot quickly
- add a way to hook into the common `expect(a).toMatchInlineSnapshot(b)` signature. maybe support both by default?
- run prettier after updating snapshots if they have prettier configured.
